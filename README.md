# Share-images-to-your-friends

### Function
The app provides pictures sharing function. Like Instagram, but not that complicated. User can simply share pictures but all user online could see. 

### Techniques
The app depend on Amazon EC2. Use Parse as server to use exsisting internal classes and methods that could reduce the complexity of development. 

### Places and be improved
As my first Android Application. It still has numerous places to improve. Like user function, now it does not support remove account. Like friends section, I did not implement friend group or adding friend function. So it have a long way to go.

### Summary
Android is a complicated, powerful, and widely used platform. Lots of aspects derived from Java but integrated Â points from others. I still need more time to learn...
